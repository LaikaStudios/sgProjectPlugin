Note to developers:
    
    The PythonStatic.zip file contains all the python for this app with the exception of shotgun_config.py.
    The zip file was built by taking all the python files from IronPython 2.7 and then laying in the shotgun files.
    The shotgun_api3 directory is not used at runtime

    The cacerts.txt file was copied from shotgun_api3/lib/httplib2/cacerts.txt
    It was not readable by the httplib2 code when it lived inside the .zip file, so it had to be broken out to a real file.
    Adding a <redacted> SSL certificate didn't seem to work, so the SSL code throws an error, which is ignored by
    adding the line:  
        shotgun_api3.shotgun.NO_SSL_VALIDATION = True
    before any connections.
    To pick up this new location at runtime, there is a change to shotgun.py starting on line 1444 (that lives in the .zip file)


    Another change to the shotgun files:
        In shotgun_api3/lib/httplib2/iri2uri.py on line 72, changed 
        Old line:
            authority = authority.encode('idna')
        New line:
            authority = authority.encode('utf-8')

    Most of this was stolen/borrowed from here:
